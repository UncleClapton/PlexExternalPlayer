# External plex player

This is my personal fork of the External Plex player, which will work with remote plex servers as well as local ones using the plex-hosted media stream.

The original project can be found [Here](https://github.com/Kayomani/PlexExternalPlayer)

External Plex Player is a plex modification that allows for browsing using the web interface but then opting to play files in your standard media player.

### Installation
1. Install Chrome or Firefox
2. Install [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (Chrome) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox).
3. Extract the agent somewhere and run it at startup using a shortcut in the startup folder.
4. Run the agent manually so you get the icon in the tray. Requires .Net 4.5 on Windows, may work on Linux/mono.
4. Install the script from github or [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/13437-plex-external-player)
5. Refresh any existing plex pages you have open.
