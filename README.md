# External plex player

This is my personal fork of the External Plex player, which will work with remote plex servers as well as local ones using the plex-hosted media stream.

The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/Kayomani/PlexExternalPlayer)

External Plex Player is a plex modification that allows for browsing using the web interface but then opting to play files in your standard media player.

### Installation
1. Install Chrome or Firefox
2. Install [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (Chrome) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox).
3. Extract the agent somewhere where it won't be moved from.
4. Follow the readme.txt on how to set up the agent with your media player of choice.
5. Run it at startup using a shortcut in the startup folder.
6. Run the agent manually so you get the icon in the tray. Requires .Net 4.5 on Windows, may work on Linux/mono.
7. Install the script: [Click Me!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UncleClapton/PlexExternalPlayer/master/PlexExternalPlayer.user.js)*
8. Refresh any existing plex pages you have open.

*If the install dialog does not immediately appear for you in Firefox, a banner with the option to install the script should appear after the script loads.
